# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – CodeAlpha Internship (Task-1)

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains Task-1 of my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship.  
The project focuses on building a machine learning classification model using the famous Iris dataset to predict the species of Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **Iris.csv**, which includes the following columns:

- SepalLengthCm  
- SepalWidthCm  
- PetalLengthCm  
- PetalWidthCm  
- Species  

---

## 🧠 Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Perform basic EDA  
3. Split the dataset into training & testing sets  
4. Train a Decision Tree Classifier  
5. Make predictions  
6. Evaluate accuracy and classification performance  
7. Save results and include screenshots
